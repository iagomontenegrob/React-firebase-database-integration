# React-firebase-integration
Functional integration between react and firebase. In this application you can simulate the registration of an user and, in real time, see your records in a list of users that is load from the information obtained on firebase db.

### Pre-requisites
You have to install **Node.js**.

### Installation
Run these commands in the project folder

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Config
If you still don’t have a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account. Log in your account, go to the console and create a project. After entering the project, look for ‘add Firebase to your app on web’, it will create a code just like the one below:

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.6.0/firebase.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize Firebase
  var config = {
    apiKey: "<YOUR-API-KEY>",
    authDomain: "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>",
    storageBucket: "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "<YOUR-MESSAGING-SENDER-ID>"
  };
  firebase.initializeApp(config);
</script>
```
In the project, update the **DB_CONFIG** in the file **/Config/config.js** with all the gathered information.

### Database Permissions
Verify the rules file of the database. The **Rules** file can be found on the second tab of menu database. If necessary, edit it, leaving the file as shown below:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```
